TODO: 	

Working on printing: 
	tried writing to JPEG and sending - problem is not the file format but some info I'm sending. pageformat?
	if pageformat setting works, remove jPG and buffered image stuff

- Questions for Nick:
	CRUD system - consists of a 
		database - recommends using an SQL library/database vs reading/writing to a file. 
			advantages:
				SQL queries already built and implemented, so I don't have to write accessing the file and looping through it with conditions in Java myself
				it's faster than reading the file and looping through it in JAva? or it's optimized, whereas my code might not be?
			my concerns are: 
				is there still a file you can open and do that? 
				because people need to edit the data on a large scale - eg, delete many entries at once, import many entries at once.
				would I do that in a GUI and then send the info to the database?
				but it's sort of like reimplementing Excel/notepad at that point, vs having them edit the file directly? 
			the database would reside on the server computer. the computer would also have a program that is a:
		server - this is where you would write a REST API? 
		(here graphical) user interface - suggests website - he suggests html with javascript and css, and I can make it into a desktop app with electron
			why? because graphics have been made really easy in that format? I have trouble debugging javascript and keeping it clean.  

1. Separate all logic from display and test
2. Static application state
2a. Encapsulate all variability
	Item info easy to edit - how open on excel? 
3. Other GUI libraries research, or make GUI beautiful and easy, and fix bugs
	indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled
5. Multiple computers - 
6. Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
7. Save orders from last week - clear visually when want to
	
		
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
more than 20 items in an order - 
orders from multiple days- put all on one screen but in order? or diff screens to click thru? 
edit existing orders
autopopulation eg of company, item
error checking of input info
print from Mac
change settings within app, eg label size
possibly I should include a lot # and/or pack date in the bar code
error check people invalid input - customers, products, invalid dates, gtins
ck lot code with Jessie - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
what do if company name is really long? do they only put in abbreviations? right now I have up to 24 characters, size-wise
make UI prettier/cleaner, remove all bugs - 
search for all todos, system printlns - 
add warning popup before deleting order - 
Import to quickbooks - 
	select which orders to import - 
	IIF file - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or?  
better - non glitchy - implementation of scrollbar
fractional items?
ship date vs pack/pick date in item, order, display, csv
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
SAve ip address in a config file so don't have to enter every time
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell
