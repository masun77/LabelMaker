TODO: 	
	
- ideas/abstractions from Nick

- test printing multiple. encapsulate variability of printer and label size - config file? 
- clear up and make one verson of this client-server, backup stuff

1. Separate all logic from display and test. Encapsulate all variability. 
2. Static application state
	Item info easy to edit - how open on excel? 
3. Other GUI libraries research, or make GUI beautiful and easy, and fix bugs
	indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled
5. Multiple computers - 
6. Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
7. Save orders from last week - clear visually when want to
	
		
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
more than 20 items in an order - 
orders from multiple days- put all on one screen but in order? or diff screens to click thru? 
edit existing orders
autopopulation eg of company, item
error checking of input info
print from Mac
change settings within app, eg label size
possibly I should include a lot # and/or pack date in the bar code
error check people invalid input - customers, products, invalid dates, gtins
ck lot code with Jessie - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
what do if company name is really long? do they only put in abbreviations? right now I have up to 24 characters, size-wise
make UI prettier/cleaner, remove all bugs - 
search for all todos, system printlns - 
add warning popup before deleting order - 
Import to quickbooks - 
	select which orders to import - 
	IIF file - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or?  
better - non glitchy - implementation of scrollbar
fractional items?
ship date vs pack/pick date in item, order, display, csv
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
SAve ip address in a config file so don't have to enter every time
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell


DONE:
Solved printing problem! After trying many attributes, pageformats, classes... I had to pick a close-enough media-size-name 
	and set it and print onto that
