	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
	clean up code - comment, test, broken down clearly
 - what need to do next? is it good enough to test run?
Test - see TEST

Christina: meat labels
- do you think they need to be able to do meat? how do it - by the lb? all 67 lbs in 1 label?

CSA labels... different format

Test...see below



	
TEST - every function, multiple times, in diff orders + with server running
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
