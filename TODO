TDD cycle: 
1. Write a test. Run it to see if it fails.
2. Add a small amount of code to make it run. Run all tests to verify it passes. 
4. Refactor and run tests again to verify.  

Why TDD? 
1. Make sure you're clear on what your goal actually is. 
2. Don't write useless code. 
3. Write code in small enough chunks that you can verify that it's correct, and debugging is easy.
4. Maintain your focus by writing small things so you don't get distracted, lost, or confused or write useless code;
and by creating easy times to take breaks and check-in on your goals - in between cycles. 
5. Keep your code correct at all times or know immediately that it doesn't work and what broke, by
having tests for all your code that are easy to run, and running them frequently - every cycle. 
6. Keep your code clean by refactoring frequently - every cycle. 

Print label graphic to correct size and orientation on label -
