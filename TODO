TODO

TDD cycle: 
1. Write a test. Run it to see if it fails.
2. Add a small amount of code to make it run. Run all tests to verify it passes. 
4. Refactor and run tests again to verify.  

Why TDD? 
1. Make sure you're clear on what your goal actually is. 
2. Don't write useless code. 
3. Write code in small enough chunks that you can verify that it's correct, and debugging is easy.
4. Maintain your focus by writing small things so you don't get distracted, lost, or confused or write useless code;
and by creating easy times to take breaks and check-in on your goals - in between cycles. 
5. Keep your code correct at all times or know immediately that it doesn't work and what broke, by
having tests for all your code that are easy to run, and running them frequently - every cycle. 
6. Keep your code clean by refactoring frequently - every cycle. 

Print label graphic to correct size and orientation on label - 
	label is 4" wide by 3.5" tall
	see: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/microsoft-print-to-pdf-custom-paper-sizes-possible/90ed3d48-1ece-4ca5-8d3b-ff0af24a7b37
	make larger - DONE
	make save on other 180 deg - DONE
	just need to make it bigger - so it's scannable - 
	
Change graphic to exclude info - 
	scannable - 

De-couple classes and make interfaces for everything - 

Make savable/printable from other formats - 
	jpg or what format can every printer print?
	can every printer print from the print dialog? what is the universal printer specification? 

Read orders from Excel file - 
	open Excel file and read any data - DONE
	choose what data need to be able to read, and what format it will be in - 
	read data into orders and items - 
		ah - I need a product code -> description, name, unit, GTIN database/sheet
	what to do on errors, e.g.: - 
		 bad customer - 
		 not enough info on line - 
		 wrong spreadsheet format - 
		 wrong filetype - 
		 file not found - 
		 bad shipvia - 
		 bad item code - 
		 bad rate (e.g. not a number) - 
	autopopulation needed at all? e.g. to verify they typed in the item they meant to type, show description? -> maybe happens in excel sheet rather than here
	minimize duplication of entered info? eg date, accounts receivable, 
Print multiple labels from Excel File - 
	verify GTINs correct
Write existing orders to excel file - 
Display of stored orders - 
Print stored orders - 
Write order to correct format for IIF file for import to quickbooks - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or? 

TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable


LATER:
go straight to print on label printer, instead of from app to pdf to print? ck what format works for all printers
View orders in scrollable pane - 
make hrv align with bar segments
what if the input isn't an excel file
error check people invalid input - customers, products, invalid dates, gtins
bar code dimensions within specs
ck lot code with Jessie - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
get own CRC code working
