TODO: 	

- yikes - someone needs to clean up that item data

- add push from server on update
	
- indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled; and ability to set
- Save orders from last week - clear visually when want to
	
- write instructions for opening |-separated file in excel, or make simpler somehow...
	and saving it in the same format 

- Make GUI beautiful and easy and clean - a gift to use
	make (some) sizes in relation to window
	test all things you could do x many times in a row

Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
	clean up code - comment, test, broken down clearly
	
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
implement better http server idea from Nick 
implement better database idea from Nick
more than 20 items in an order - 
edit existing orders
?include a lot # and/or pack date in the bar code
ck lot code with Jesse - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
search for all todos, system printlns - 
Import to quickbooks - 
	select which orders to import - 
	IIF file - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or?  
ship date vs pack/pick date in item, order, display, csv
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell
reset settings from config files while running? vs just closing and reopening the app?


DONE:
Solved printing problem! After trying many attributes, pageformats, classes... I had to pick a close-enough media-size-name 
	and set it and print onto that
	printing multiple works!
