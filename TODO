TODO: 

- date filter not working
- ability to add note to label, eg ATTN 
alphabetize items
order orders by date

Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
	clean up code - comment, test, broken down clearly

	
TEST - every function, multiple times, in diff orders
	
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
make label format editing function
why does PTT25 scan wrong/not scan?
archive orders - put in separate file, save file backup, client/server, etc.... 
	home button to archive, to view archived; there to unarchive selected, to delete archived orders etc
	auto-archive when? maybe if today is a monday? archive last weeks and delete older? 
better method for changing items - maybe do need to add/switch to an excel reader so can update from the excel spreadsheet?
implement better http server idea from Nick 
- indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled; and ability to set
implement better database idea from Nick
more than 20 items in an order - 
search for all todos, system printlns - 
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell
reset settings from config files while running? vs just closing and reopening the app?
add missing items? eg meats
alphabetize items on insertion
alphabetize orders on insertion
freeze header row and column
check out React.js and Node
consider web-app

DONE:
Solved printing problem! After trying many attributes, pageformats, classes... I had to pick a close-enough media-size-name 
	and set it and print onto that
	printing multiple works!
