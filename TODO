TODO: 	

- export from QB -> read into label program!
- label updates from Tim, Christina
- show PO in top company label
- is scanning affected by that missing line?
- ability to add note to label, eg ATTN
- select date range for order display
- show product, unit/code in next column, total num of units on left with that, then each order


Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
	clean up code - comment, test, broken down clearly
	
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
Jeezzzz - need to fix alignment and spacing of display, esp with cleanliness/understanding of code
why does PTT25 scan wrong?
Make GUI beautiful and easy and clean - a gift to use
	make (some) sizes in relation to window
archive orders - put in separate file, save file backup, client/server, etc.... 
	home button to archive, to view archived; there to unarchive selected, to delete archived orders etc
	auto-archive when? maybe if today is a monday? archive last weeks and delete older? 
don't close order entry on order save... - but not too slow... 
better method for changing items - maybe do need to add/switch to an excel reader so can update from the excel spreadsheet?
implement better http server idea from Nick 
push from server to clients on update - does that mean client has to be running a 'server' program too? or does http take care of that?
- indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled; and ability to set
implement better database idea from Nick
more than 20 items in an order - 
edit existing orders
?include a lot # and/or pack date in the bar code
ck lot code with Jesse - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
search for all todos, system printlns - 
Import to quickbooks - 
	select which orders to import - 
	IIF file - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or?  
ship date vs pack/pick date in item, order, display, csv
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell
reset settings from config files while running? vs just closing and reopening the app?
add missing items? eg meats
alphabetize items on insertion
alphabetize orders on insertion
freeze header row and column
larger VP code
add total num labels to label display

DONE:
Solved printing problem! After trying many attributes, pageformats, classes... I had to pick a close-enough media-size-name 
	and set it and print onto that
	printing multiple works!
