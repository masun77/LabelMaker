TODO: 	

Working on: encapsulating all variability: adding UI functions.
	
- ideas/abstractions from Nick, esp database and client/server
- encapsulate variability of printer and label size - config file? 
- clear up and make one verson of this client-server, backup stuff
- Item info easy to edit - how open on excel? 
- Make GUI beautiful and easy and clean - a gift to use
- indication - checks or colors or something - of picked, packed, labeled; and ability to set
- Save orders from last week - clear visually when want to


Maintainability - 
	make code totally clean, tested, commented, interfaces - encapsulation
	what could vary? how would they change it? 
	what factors affect the stability of the application? 
	who/what skills would they need to maintain this down the line?
	
TESTS:
- print with 1 label
- print with multiple labels
- bar codes scannable- test with real life tests, eg all orders for a day and viewing and printing and scanning all of them

LATER:
more than 20 items in an order - 
edit existing orders
autopopulation eg of company, item
print from Mac
?include a lot # and/or pack date in the bar code
error check invalid input - customers, products, invalid dates, gtins
ck lot code with Jesse - I did YYMMDD. can change to whatever. 
what do if company name is really long? do they only put in abbreviations? right now I have up to 24 characters, size-wise
search for all todos, system printlns - 
add warning popup before deleting order - 
Import to quickbooks - 
	select which orders to import - 
	IIF file - 
	how get invoice number? user enters? or auto on import? or?  
better - non glitchy - implementation of scrollbar?
ship date vs pack/pick date in item, order, display, csv
if you edit the server data so that the order numbers are no longer in order/not sequential, error on reading in dataSaver
SAve ip address in a config file so don't have to enter every time
Get a new computer - solid state, Dell


DONE:
Solved printing problem! After trying many attributes, pageformats, classes... I had to pick a close-enough media-size-name 
	and set it and print onto that
	printing multiple works!
